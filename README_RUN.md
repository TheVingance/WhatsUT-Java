# How to Run WhatsUT

This project consists of a Server and a Client. They must be run in separate terminals.

## 1. Start the Server
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
mvn exec:java
```
You should see "Server is running...". Keep this terminal open.

## 2. Start the Client
Open a **new, separate terminal** and run:
```bash
mvn javafx:run
```
The application window should open. Connect using the login or register screens.
